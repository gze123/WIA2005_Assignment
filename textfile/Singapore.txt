 singapore home multiple opposition parties, eight nine regularly contesting general elections. poorly defined policies, dearth public engagement, disunity stymied performance decades. 
  
 now, following shock election result neighboring malaysia, opposition parties say they’re trying change that.

 “the current lack debate parliament unhealthy,” said goh meng seng, secretary general three-year-old opposition group, people’s power party. “there needs diversity opinions decision-making processes, — isn’t strong contest ideas, parliament sittings won’t taken seriously.” 
 helmed prime minister lee hsien loong, eldest son singapore’s founding father lee kuan yew, pap controls 83 seats 89-strong parliament. remaining six country’s largest opposition faction, workers’ party, whose performance 2011 election saw pap’s vote share drop lowest-ever level 60.1 percent. 2015, pap saw margin strengthen 69.9 percent, boosted wave nostalgia lee kuan yew’s death year well government spending around country’s golden jubilee anniversary, extra financial support senior citizens’ healthcare. 
  
 parliamentary majority, pap can easily change laws. late 2016, modified eligibility criteria presidential candidates ensure representation minority ethnic groups, resulted one candidate qualifying 2017 presidential election. 
  
 “the weakness individual parties prevented meaningful inroads political system, we’re realizing can longer go alone,” said chee soon juan, leader singapore democratic party, 38-year-old opposition faction hosted july’s meeting. 
  
 prime minister’s office didn’t respond cnbc’s request comment.

 biggest opposition party didn’t participate 
 even opposition parties able unite — tall order given disparate interests — it’s certain successful be. 
  
 workers’ party, seen realistic alternative pap, didn’t attend july’s meeting, leading speculation may interested coalition. declined interviewed story. 
  
 without workers’ party, however, opposition coalition faces obstacles. 
  
 one, rules restricting freedom expression public assemblies limited opposition’s engagement public. individuals media organizations criticize government judiciary faced civil defamation lawsuits restrictions government, according 2017 report human rights watch. 
  
 opposition leaders blame government hindering respective parties, experts say it’s simple.

 groups except workers’ party “tend go political hibernation general elections,” said. “opposition unity also threadbare, ability pool resources forte either.”

 island may lack strong wave anti-government sentiment, discontent rising prices doubts pap’s future leadership work opposition’s favor. 
  
 despite electoral mandate, pap criticized many citizens 30 percent increase water prices year’s 16.8 percent increase electricity tariffs. country’s goods services tax also expected hit 9 percent, 7 percent currently. 
  
 matter exacerbated entrenched perceptions inequality. government report released earlier year revealed slower pace income growth bottom 50 percent households, contributing widening gap rich poor. sizable program transfers, subsidies assistance exist low-income singaporeans, social imbalances remain.

 haunted past 
 pap, race general election will dominated two main concerns: ensuring smooth roll-out leadership succession plan maintaining dominance even confronted host new challenges. 
 pap looks ahead, haunted two events electoral past: 1991 2011. 
 first supposed election celebrated handover first generation leaders second. 
 najib says malaysia-singapore jousting over. really? 
 nine months taking singapore’s first prime minister lee kuan yew, goh chok tong announced snap election, seeking mandate gentler approach politics. instead reciprocating warm embrace, voters gave cold shoulder. 
 pap won just 61 per cent popular vote, lowest since independence time. opposition also took four seats year, stinging rebuke goh. 
  
 twenty years later, 2011, pap suffered worst performance election since independence 1965, 60.1 per cent popular vote. analysts agree voters wanted register firm unhappiness issues rapid growth foreigner population singapore, rising cost living growing income gap.

 fact, uncertainty just new normal pap big cause concern ruling party; unlikely 2015, 2011 actually closer reality? 
 worry, coupled next pap leadership transition progress, probably ruling party increasingly harsh critics recent years, says nus’s singh. 
  
 instance, k. shanmugam, pap’s law minister, grilled oxford historian thum ping tjin, prominent critic government, recent parliament committee hearing testimonial falsehood fake news. thum accused pap one spread falsehoods past. 
 shanmugam later explained questioned thum academic made serious allegations lee, including calling liar. keeping quiet therefore option, said. 
 show force, pap legislators also insisted two wp legislators apologise statements made parliament, leading internet chatter pap bullying wp. one them, leon perera, non-constituency mp – post created allow top losing mps speak parliament – apologise parliament, other, wp chairman lim, refused. 
 “the pap hits [wp] hard sails picking winds pap strategists don’t like,” observed bilveer singh, nus. 
 pap faces dilemma. hit wp hard destroy opposition, something reluctant do. pap knows return days all-pap parliament, analysts said. bad optics government. 
 “this real dilemma. want angry destructive opposition rise, will certainly case opposition parties like wp butchered marginalised somehow tolerate malleable wp?” singh noted. 
 “i guess pap prefer latter.” 
 case, pap walk fine line allowing opposition allowing grow extent becomes real threat. 
 many governments, seem like formidable challenge odds stacked favour. pap long known obsession longevity will act ensure party’s future secure. 
  
 wild cards beware 
 pap leaders also likely wary challenges former establishment figures emerge blind spots. 
 one continued drama oxley road, home lee kuan yew. lee siblings, lee hsien yang lee wei ling, publicly bickering elder brother prime minister lee future home. 
 younger lee siblings want family home demolished, saying lee kuan yew’s express desire. singapore government disputing far refrained taking action either demolish preserve site. 
 they’re again: lee kuan yew home must razed, younger children insist 
 prime minister lee even address issue parliament last year, opening family quarrels public scrutiny. 
 issue far over. just week, siblings criticised ministerial committee said option keeping house historical site remains open. 
 possibility twists store front, scandalise embarrass prime minister date next election draws closer. 
 second wild card emergence former pap legislator contest party fought for. tan cheng bock ran president 2011, without approval pap, lost sliver – 7,000 votes – former deputy prime minister tony tan. 
 denied chance contest last year’s presidential election turned reserved election, malays run. former parliament speaker halimah yacob ran won unopposed, two candidates disqualified. 
 tan ruled running general election opposition candidate, sources telling week asia assembling team eyeing wards west singapore previously mp pap. 
 smu’s tan said surprise tan cheng bock take jump. 
 entry give pap additional worry singapore crosses halfway mark last next general election. 
 singapore’s next leader, can bridge english-mandarin divide? 
 pap, outcome question – never was. will romp victory continue dominate parliament. 
 devil details: will get navigating growing desire checks balances among electorate? 
 wp, remain credible opposition singapore offer. can continue post-low era? 
 amid uncertainties parties, balance will found new leaders setting fresh equilibrium politics singapore next decade.
