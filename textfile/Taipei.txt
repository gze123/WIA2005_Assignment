 taiwan, place woman politics 
  
 friday, tsai ing-wen became taiwan's first female president. 
  
 never burning ambition cat-loving former law professor president, virtually unique among east asia's female leaders. 
  
 unlike south korea's president park geun-hye philippines' former president corazon aquino, thailand's former pm yingluck shinawatra, follow father, brother husband position power. 
  
 unusual taiwan. 
  
 many taiwan's female politicians, including former vice-president annette lu, kaohsiung city mayor chen chu, chair kuomintang party hung hsiu-chu, rose powerful positions without come political family. largely made own. 
  
 women also shine taiwan's parliament. island's women legislators even seen leading charge taiwan's infamous parliament scuffles. 
  
 following january elections, now record percentage women legislators 38%, putting taiwan far ahead asian countries, international average 22%, nations, including uk, germany, us. 
  
 four ms tsai's 40 cabinet members women? 
  
 cabinet spokesman blamed dearth experienced women party power many years fact women elected posts. admit women turned offer job top table. 
 one them, 65-year-old ho mei-yueh, former economics minister, told devoted 33 years life government, putting needs second also raising family. just wants time now. perennial question work-life balance many women. 
  
 "i work look kids. person neglect myself," said ms ho. "would man age turn offer? men, young, give much themselves, burden taking care children fall them. many men, job life." 
  
 still, natural taiwan see women politics little fuss made ms tsai's gender. 
  
 take closer look clear quotas behind relatively high percentages taiwanese women politics. stipulate women must get half "at-large" seats legislature one every four seats electoral districts local council elections. 
  
 "it's constitution special positions women. scandinavian countries adopted similar policies. certainly unique asia parts world," said joyce gelb, new york-based professor, studied taiwanese women's participation politics. 
  
 also helped commitment women's representation even early decades republic china's existence, history women's activism, well society many highly educated professional women able take positions leadership, scholars say.

 chanting slogans like “taiwan taiwan” “we independent country,” thousands took streets taipei weekend demand outright independence china.   
  
 first rally since president tsai ing-wen traditionally pro-independence democratic progressive party (dpp) took power 2016. 
  
 formosa alliance, pro-independence political group founded april, said 120,000 participated saturday demonstration. police put number much smaller 6,000. 
  
 still, idea taiwan independence unacceptable china. fact, past months, chinese government aggressively lobbying global companies, including airlines, remove references taiwan country region separate china. 
  
 rally, protesters held cardboards said, “no bullying,” apparent reference china’s effort erase taiwan’s international identity.

 taiwan’s status? 
  
 taiwan certainly self-governing island. since 1949, losers bloody chinese civil war, kuomintang kmt (also known nationalist party china), fled chinese mainland settled island. 
  
 decades, ruling kmt maintained legitimate ruler of china. recognized pretty much everyone, including us united nations. 
  
 but, 1972, president richard nixon resumed relations communist party-led china. that’s country’s famously ambiguous “one-china policy” devised. 
  
 us acknowledged “all chinese either side taiwan strait maintain one china taiwan part china.” time, us specify whether beijing taipei legitimate government. 
  
 us ditched formal diplomatic relations taiwan favor china 1979, although washington remains island’s main ally two sides work together unofficially. 
  
 “one-china policy,” though, created deliberate “strategic ambiguity” allowed taiwan mainland china flourish economically. source “status quo” keeps peace today.

 exactly, then, taiwan independence? 
  
 different views this. 
  
 formosa alliance, organized weekend demonstration calling official, binding referendum decide taiwan declare outright independence. 
  
 mean changing island’s official name taiwan, instead republic china, joining united nations full member. taiwan currently member united nations. 
  
 china react? 
  
 chinese government tolerates current situation. often said taiwan inalienable part china eventual unification must achieved, force necessary.

 taiwanese support independence? 
  
 minority taiwanese want achieve independence soon possible, according national chengchi university taiwan, conducting opinion polls subject since 1994. 
  
 recent poll june found 4.8% respondents supported immediate independence. 
  
 “the rally one single event people expressed opinion, doesn’t mean majority taiwanese people support independence,” liu fu-kuo national chengchi university told inkstone. 
  
 overwhelming majority respondents said preferred keeping status quo now, preferences future taiwan differed. 
  
 "america will always believe taiwan’s embrace democracy shows better path chinese people," said mike pence speech early october.

 us thinking this? 
  
 fan shih-ping, political scientist national taiwan normal university, said declaring outright independence risky move. 
  
 “it questionable us support taiwan independence. it’s guaranteed china strongly oppose might even send troops,” said. 
  
 “we haven’t seen us supportive taiwan since 1979, even vice president mike pence supported taiwan publicly, calling symbol democracy chinese people." 
  
 declaring independence anger china, may also alienate us, taiwan’s biggest supporter. 
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
 taiwan's president: fighting reform 
  
 president tsai seeks move taiwan broader, constructive role indo-pacific region. 
  
 resident tsai ing-wen sophisticated, professional woman strong resume: lawyer, world trade organization negotiator, mainland affairs council chair, legislator, vice premier, democratic progressive party (dpp) chair. organization negotiators will tell attention detail stunning carries characteristic today president. 
  
 tsai came office understanding challenges facing nation set meet attention detail pursued world trade organization negotiator. 
  
 first item: taiwan’s government pension plans teetering edge bankruptcy. need reform desperate. cutting payments never easy, going zero real possibility nothing done. president dpp legislature moved address issue. recent blog national interest, kwei-bo huang called reform “rude.” real “rudeness” nothing leave pensioners high dry. 
  
 also “rude” states huang tsai government’s move implement “transitional justice”—dealing past state sponsored human-rights violations. law’s objectives include truth seeking, compensation victims, bringing social reconciliation. 
  
 kuomintang (kmt) kept taiwan severe martial law thirty-eight years. thousands jailed executed pursuing democratic reforms human rights. record clearly shows brutal authoritarian rule chiangs, yet huang whines “no clear definition ‘authoritarian’” play dpp gone far seeks remove public symbols authoritarian past, read statues chiang kai-shek, deal assets stolen state coffers individual citizens. 
  
 labor standards act stirred intense debate taiwan, revisions made based input wide cross section labor business leaders, government stands ready listen amend law needed. balancing demands moving compromise name game governance president tsai knows full well. 
  
 president’s 5+2 major economic development programs designed meet serious issues wage stagnation widening wealth gap providing new opportunities industries across board well agriculture. 
 dpp government understands need secure energy supply reduction carbon pollution. plans underway bring renewable energy 20 percent taiwan’s supply 2025, add lng energy mix get serious conservation measures. sectors business community might feel “unease” energy supply, huang indicates, greater sense unease permeates body politic dangers inherent nuclear power plants sitting earthquake faults. nightmare images fukushima disaster haunt taiwan’s citizens nuclear-free homeland dream. getting demands tsai’s attention detail—and gets it. 
  
 kmt power fifty years, bulk government funding concentrated kmt’s northern taiwan base. forward-looking infrastructure development program huang laments designed balance development throughout island. economic stimulus project includes investment rail transportation, water environment, urban rural development, digital development green energy. 
  
   
 huang shows true-blue colors blames president tsai’s “nonchalance” current state cross-strait relations. well, huang insinuates, kmt bowed 1992 consensus, now lost tsai refuses kneel. ginned kmt’s su chi 2000, consensus “convenient fiction” claimed prc roc agreed “one china” “own interpretation.” one small problem, however, prc side never agreed “different interpretations” part equation. one china prc it. way president tsai, democratically elected official sovereign entity known republic china, can agree minion prc. 
  
 so, yes, prc cut official exchanges taiwan, cut number chinese tourists, flown aircraft around island floats aircraft carrier around taiwan’s periphery. tsai’s fault kowtowing? president tsai gone way provocative call dialogue china. rigorous maintaining status quo across strait—with taiwan’s democratic way life preserved. rebuffed fault own. shoe, dr. huang, chinese foot. 
  
   
 final note: new southbound policy tactic con taiwan public away cross-strait issues. rather detailed policy integrating taiwan wider asian region cultural, education, economic political links. 
  
 dr. huang kmt continue look longingly china. president tsai’s vision much wider, seeking move taiwan broader, constructive role indo-pacific region. don’t underestimate her.
